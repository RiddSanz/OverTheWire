NatasX.labs.natas.overthewire.org
(X) stands for level 
NOTE: This level was using WebUI, not SSH anymore. So, open it with your favourite browser

natas0: natas0
see it trough view-source:(website)

natas1: 0nzCigAq7t2iALyvU9xcHlYN4MlkIwlq
same method as natas0

natas2: TguMNxKo1DSa1tujBLuZJnDUlCcUAPlI
this one using Dir exploit vulnerabilities trough /files/user.txt

natas3: 3gqisGdR0pjm6tpkDKdIWO2hSvchLeYH
guidance filename is robot.txt, then u will be guided to the /s3cr3t/ directory that contains the credentials
to the next level

natas4: QryZXc2e0zahULdHrtHxzyYkj59kUxLQ
use burpsuite, go to proxy>intercept then enable the intercept to change the request
and change the referrer to natas 5 then refresh (i hate this level)

natas5: 0n35PkggAPm2zbEpOU802c0x0Msn1ToK
change the value cookie LoggedIn=0 to 1

natas6: 0RoJwHdSKWFTYR5WuiAewauSuNaBXned
goto "view source code" then copy the includes/secret.inc, paste the thing to replace the index address
then after opening the secret you will get the actual secret, the secret is= FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU

natas8: xcoXLmzMkoIP9D7hlgPlh9XD7OgLAe5Q
we gonna use: gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
first of all, we gotta decode it FROM hex > reverse > base64
(lastPwd: oubWYf2kBq)

natas9: ZE1ck82lmdGIoErlhQgWND6j2Wzz6b6t
http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=;cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas10
so basically, the semicolon (;) has successfully triggered the level to force access to the shell command
cause also, the input is unsanitized 

natas10: t7I5VHvpa14sJTUGV0cbEsbYfFP2dmOu
http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=%0Acat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas11
cause the input was sanitized, we cant use the semicolon vulnerabilities anymore.
To do so, i'm using some certain of "universal cheat code" things

natas11: UJdqkK1pTu6VLt9UHWAgRZz6sVUZ3lEk
(open the natas11.txt for guidance)

natas12: yZdkjAYZRd3R7tq7T5kXMjMJlOIkzDeB
upload SCnatas12.php to the shell, open it, and try to obtain shell access by 
<RandomStr>.php?e=cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13.
If file doesnt shown as .php, then change it urself via burpsuite
(script will be provided later)

natas13: trbs5pCjCrkuSknBBKHhaBxq6Wm1j3LC
method was kinda similar to the prev level, but here is the upgraded version.
So, u can upload the script and do the same. But, make sure to check the file first,
cause u have to delete the dumpText thats used to trick the system.

natas14: z3UYcr4v4uBpeX8f7EZbMHlzK4UR2XtQ
the password is= (" or 1=1 --) without ()
input the parameters above as password and username

natas15: SdqIqBsFcz3yotlNYErZSZwblkm0lrvx
for this level we got no vulnerabilities found, theres only true or false value thats given by the level 
by giving the "natas16" user as true, so we got a bruteforce script (provided at repo)

natas16: hPkjKYviLQctEW33QmuXL6eDVfMW4sGo
(I surrender guys, i had to use the bruteforce)

natas17: EqjHJbo7LFNb8vwhHb9s75hokh5TF0OC
same as Natas15, but we didnt get the result if the user is true or false.
so, we gotta reverse engineering into it, by taking advantage of time dilation sleep()

natas18: 6OG1PbKdVjyBlpxgD4DDbRG6ZLlCGgCJ
we gonna login as admin, but actually just change the the PHPSESSID to 119, via DevTools / F12
or alternatively, you can use my script
after that u can add "/index.php?debug" to the url

natas19: tnwER7PdfWkxsG4FNWUtoAZ9VyZTJqJr
same method as before, but the PHPSESSID is harder to obtain, cause it is now encrypted.
dont worry, the script is also provided. The new PHPSESSID=3238312d61646d696e

natas20: p5mCvP7GS2K6Bmt3gqhM2Fc1A5T8MVyw
for this level you need burpsuite, go trough proxy> intercept> turn it on, and open browser
input any username, then edit the request by right clicking and edit the user=test%0aadmin%201
before continue pls right click and add to repeater
then, edit the url and add ?debug to the end of it.
it mostly doesnt work at the first try, so just try until you succeed:D

natas21: BPhv63cKE1lkQl04cE5CuFTzXe15NfiH
first of all, open both of natas21 and experimenter at burpsuite, the credentials are the same
burpsuite as usual, go to the experimenter website, edit the string between yellow"HERE"&submit=update
add &admin=1 there, dont forget the ?debug, and copy the PHPSESSID, paste it to the natas21 DevTools

natas22: d8rwGBl0Xslg3b76uh3fEbSlnOUBlozz
at burpsuite, add "/index.php?twilio" to the url, and before the page reload for the 2nd time, find the
code 302 at HTTP history, open it, then see on response. Your password will be there

natas23: dIUQcI3uSus1JEOSSWRAEXBG8KbR8tRs
pass for this one is: 100iloveyou

natas24: MeuqmfJ8DDKuTr5pcvzFKSwlxedZYEWd
add [] to revert the password to NULL, like this:
"?passwd[]=(you can put anything here)"

natas25: ckELKUWZUfpOv6uxS6M7lXBpBssJZ4Ws
http://natas25.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?lang=....//....//....//....//....//var/www/natas/natas25/logs/natas25_0e3c98mfekmb44k7v956rarobu.log
"0e3c98mfekmb44k7v956rarobu" are my session id, replace it with yours (F12 > apps > cookie)
then do intercept, replace the "User-agent:" with= " <?php echo shell_exec("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas26"); ?> "
after that, take a look at HTTP history, and the request you edited and see the response tab.
if you see a random string apeeared there, thats ur password for the next level
