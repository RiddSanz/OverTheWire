cookie(BaseForm) - HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUcqOE1JZjUIBis7ABdmbU1GIjEJAyIxTRg=

plaintext - {"showpassword":"yes","bgcolor":"#ffffff"}
(at first, the parameters is no, we gotta change it onto)

cipertext - f$ 
3'7 

key - eDWo

result - HmYkBwozJw4WNyAAFyB1VUc9MhxHaHUNAic4Awo2dVVHZzEJAyIxCUc5

NOTE:
The formula is we gotta copy the cookies via pressing F12 > application > data
Then knowing the encryption that was used to encrypt the string.
Basically, its encrypted from base64 then used XOR. 
By XOR-ing the string, we know thats just 4letter thats being used repeatedly
By that conclusion, we put the 4 digit key as XOR formula, and the plaintext as subject.
After all of that done, encrypt that back to base64 then replace the previous cookie.
